RNAG - Block Gibbs Sampler for RNA Secondary Structure Prediction
version 1.2

Installation
Unpack the zip file. If you're reading this, you probably already have.
You will need some auxiliary programs in order to run RNAG:

probcons - available from http://probcons.stanford.edu/download.html
Infernal package - available from http://eddylab.org/infernal/
Vienna RNA package - available from http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/
Matlab or GNU Octave
python 3.x

Note: Matlab is a commercial product and requires a license.
Octave may be freely obtained from http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/
Octave is an free, open source alternative to Matlab. However,
it doesn't have all of the features of Matlab. In particular, Octave
seems lacking in the area of clustering. Currently, there are Octave
equivalents for pdist() and linkage() but not cluster() used in
hier_clus.m. A workaround for clustering is to use
mykmeans.m from http://www.christianherta.de/kmeans.html.

To use octave, edit rnag_init.py and change the line 'octave_prog = ...' to contain
the locatyion of teh octave executable. Change the line 'use_octave = 0' to 
'use_octave = 1'. 

Once the additional packages are installed, you will need to edit the file
rnag_init.py to point the variables to the correct locactions.

Running RNAG
To run, enter: 
python <path to rnag.py>
at the command prompt. This will display the command line options:

RNAG 1.2.0 2022-05-04
usage: python rnag.py fasta_file <iterations> <gamma_option> <Rfam_ID>
iterations - number of iterations, burn-in plus sample (optional, default = 1000)
gamma_option - 1 for range of gamma values (optional, default = 0)
Rfam_ID -  compare results to Rfam (optional, default = none)
